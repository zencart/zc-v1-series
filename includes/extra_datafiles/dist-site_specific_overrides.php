 * A collection of site-specific overrides for the storefront operation.

 * There are some features in the base Zen Cart processing that can be overridden for a specific
 * site, as identified in this module.
 *
 * For use on YOUR site, make a copy of this file (which has all entries commented-out) to /includes/extra_datafiles/site_specific_overrides.php
 * and make your edits there.  Otherwise, your overrides might get "lost" on a future Zen Cart upgrade.  The 'base' Zen Cart definitions
 * of these variables are set by /includes/init_includes/init_common_elements.php.

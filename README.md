Zen Cart&reg; v1.6.0
---------------

Installation
------------

Installation is simple:

1. [Download Zen Cart&reg;](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files)
2. Ensure you check that the md5/sha1 hash of the Zip matches those publically posted.
  * The md5/sha1 values for the zip files hosted at sourceforge are displayed on the Zen Cart&reg; [website](http://www.zen-cart.com/)
3. Unzip the downloaded zip file 
4. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded to your webserver â€¦ for example, into your public_html or www or html folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver)
5. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: www.your_site.com (or if you uploaded it into another foldername use www.your_site.com/foldername)
6. Rename the /includes/dist-configure.php and /admin/includes/dist-configure.php files to just "configure.php" and make the files writable.
7. Also make the /cache and /logs folders writable. (You will be prompted about making other folders writable during installation)
8. Follow the instructions that appear for installation. 

That's the abbreviated version of installation instructions!

For a MUCH more detailed set of installation instructions, see the [/docs/1.readme_installation.html](http://www.zen-cart.net/docs/1.readme_installation.html) file in your Zen Cart files.

PCI/PA-DSS Compliance

Other branches are not PA-DSS Certified unless otherwise stated.
 
__The [Implementation Guide](http://www.zen-cart.net/docs/implementation-guide.pdf) should be followed for PCI Compliant implementation.__

Zen Cart&reg; v1.6.0
--------------------
[Download latest in-development version from github](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/archive/v160.zip)

Requirements
------------
Zen Cart&reg; requires you to provide your own webserver (shared or dedicated/VPS), with a standard LAMP stack (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP), based on the following specifications

- Compatible with PHP 5.4.2 to 7.0.x
- Compatible with MySQL 5.1 to 5.7, via the PHP mysqli client
- CURL (via PHP) is used to communication with payment/shipping services
- Compatible with with Apache 2.2, (or Apache 2.4 with the backward-compatibility mode enabled for v2.2 .htaccess rules support.)
- Recommended Apache modules include: expires, headers, env, alias, deflate, ssl, mime, rewrite (in addition to other common modules)

Zen Cart&reg; can also run on Nginx, but requires that the server administrator understand properly configuring the nginx *.conf files when prompted with the recommended directives at the end of the zc_install setup phase.

Zen Cart&reg; has been reported to run on IIS, but with some limitations, namely the need to manually secure various folders with IIS equivalents to .htaccess rules.



Installation
------------

Installation is simple:

1. [Download Zen Cart&reg;](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files)
2. Ensure you check that the md5/sha1 hash of the Zip matches those publicly posted.
  * The md5/sha1 values for verifying the zip files hosted at Sourceforge are displayed on the [Zen Cart&reg; website](https://www.zen-cart.com/) along with [instructions on how to verify the file using the hash values](http://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?305).
3. Unzip the downloaded zip file 
4. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded to your webserver â€¦ for example, into your `public_html` or `www` or `html` folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver)
5. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: `www.example.com` (or if you uploaded it into another subdirectory such as `foldername` use `www.example.com/foldername`)
6. Rename the `/includes/dist-configure.php` and `/admin/includes/dist-configure.php` files to "`configure.php`" and make the files writable (so the install process can write your configuration information into them after you answer a few questions in the following steps).
7. Also make the `/cache` and `/logs` folders writable. (You will be prompted about making other folders writable during installation)
8. Follow the instructions that appear in your browser for installation. 

If some of the terms used in these brief instructions are things you don't understand, there is a much more detailed set of instructions in the [/docs/Implementation-Guide](http://www.zen-cart.com/docs/implementation-guide-v155.pdf) PDF.

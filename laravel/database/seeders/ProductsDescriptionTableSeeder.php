In the multiplayer experience, your character will have more access to travel via Ter\'angreal, Portal Stones, and the Ways. However you move around, though, you\'ll quickly discover that means of locomotion can easily become the least of the your worries...<br /><br />During your travels, you quickly discover that four locations are crucial to your success in the game. Not surprisingly, these locations are the homes of The Wheel of Time\'s main characters. Some of these places are ripped directly from the pages of Jordan\'s books, made flesh with Legend\'s unparalleled pixel-pushing ways. Other places are specific to the game, conceived and executed with the intent of expanding this game world even further. Either way, they provide a backdrop for some of the most intense first person action and strategy you\'ll have this year.',

NOTE: Select from below ... is defined as a Display Only Attribute and NOT to be included in the base price.
<br /><br />

The Display Only means, the customer may NOT select this option value. If they do not selected another option value, then the product cannot be added to the shopping cart.
<br /><br />

The NOT included in base price means, if this product were priced by attributes, it would not be include. The reason for this is so that the lowest price of this group will be the Small at $50.00 and not Select from Below at $0.00
<br /><br />

NOTE: None is similar to Display Only, but this can be used when for when no option value is required.
<br /><br />

Its value is set the value to $0.00 and it is NOT marked Display Only.
<br /><br />

Because its value is $0.00 if included in the Attributes Based Price on products Priced by Attributes, this Options group would not have any value included in the calculated price.
<br /><br />

NOTE: The Option Name: Featured is a READ ONLY Option Type
<br /><br />
Read-only attributes can be used to display repetitive information or any property that occurs on multiple products and are set up like any other type of attribute. They do not get added to the Shopping Cart and are not included in any order\'s information. When using the "Attribute Controller", each read-only attribute should have its Base Price button set to off.

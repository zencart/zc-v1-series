Zen Cart(R) - The Art of E-Commerce

Welcome to Zen Cart(R) E-Commerce

THE FOLLOWING IS A VERY SIMPLIFIED INSTALLATION DOCUMENT.
You can find online documentation at: https://docs.zen-cart.com

WE SUGGEST YOU USE ONLINE DOCS AND THE PDF "Implementation Guide" 

https://docs.zen-cart.com/release/implementation-guide-v157.pdf

FOR FULLY DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.


Zen Cart has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack and upload the code to a compatible web server:

1. Extract the Zen Cart ZIP file (and tell the unzip utility to *retain* folder structures)
2. Upload the Zen Cart files and folders to your server using your FTP program
3. You must make some folders writable. The details are in the Implementation-Guide.pdf and the online documentation. 
4. In your browser enter the URL to your website where you uploaded the files, specifically to the /zc_install/index.php file.
5. Follow the instructions. You must create your MySQL database credentials before installation, and provide those details when prompted. Details of this are in the Implementation Guide PDF.

# What is Zen Cart?

## Designed for Online Merchants

Zen Cart truly is _the art of E-Commerce;_ a free, user-friendly, open source shopping cart system. The software has been developed and kept updated by group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers, and consultants that think E-Commerce could be and should be done differently.

Some "solutions" seem to be complicated programming exercises instead of responding to users' needs, Zen Cart puts merchant and shopper requirements first.

Similarly, other programs are nearly impossible to install and use without an IT degree, while Zen Cart can be installed and setup by anyone with the most basic computer skills.

Others are so expensive. Not Zen Cart ... it is _FREE!_


## Designed for Online Shoppers

Zen Cart is the first Open Source Ecommerce platform to attain PA-DSS certification.

Zen Cart delivers the ultimate online shopping experience to your customers. Navigating through your merchandise offerings is a breeze with Zen Cart.

The program allows you to draw attention to products such as "featured" and "specials" etc in addition to the traditional category/product navigation.

Once a product is added to the shopping cart, secure checkout is a simple 3-Step process including collecting address information, shipping selection (multiple shipping methods including real-time internet shipping quotes are built-in), payment selection (_PayPal™ and AuthorizeNet™_ are just two of the various included modules) and confirming the final order including taxes and discounts/coupons/sales/gift-certificates applied.

You are immediately notified of the order and your customer automatically receives an e-mail confirmation.

The goals of Zen Cart include:

*   make the program easy to set up
*   make it easy to customize
*   automate tasks, such as order confirmation
*   make navigation simple
*   built in promotions; discount coupons, gift certificates, newsletters and product notification
*   offer single item specials and storewide discounts, including group discounts and quantity discounts
*   built in intelligent Search Engine Optimization tools, including per-product metatag controls
*   password protected Administration Tool
*   support multiple languages, currencies and tax structures

In short, Zen Cart is shopping cart software the way it should have been all along.

We simply want to deliver a fast and easy to use shopping cart program that is freely available to everyone under the GNU General Public License.

The Zen Cart development team encourages feedback and contributions from the community and we invite open discussion about e-commerce solutions.

<p>The hoster-provided or publicly available <strong>“packaged bundles” of Zen Cart are not endorsed</strong> by Zen-Cart.com.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>we recommend manual installation</strong>.  Manual installation of files from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/" target="_blank">official download</a> enables you to build a system which is secure, optimized, and up to date. Manual installation ensures that you know <em>exactly</em> what <em>you</em> have put onto your site.</p>

<p>This is a basic guide to installing Zen Cart. If you already have Zen Cart installed and wish to upgrade from a previous version to this new release, please see the upgrading instructions <a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/" target="_blank">in the Release document</a>.</p>

<p>You have <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/" target="_blank">downloaded the Zen Cart software from an official source</a>, and want to build an online shopping cart.</p>

<p>If No, stop.  You need to obtain a good <a href="/user/first_steps/useful_tools/#ftp-tools">FTP tool</a> to transfer files back and forth from your computer to <a href="/user/first_steps/hosting/#hosting-companies">your web host</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Many people have had timeout and other problems when using programs like SmartFTP and CuteFTP. We recommend that you do NOT use these problematic programs.  See <a href="/user/first_steps/useful_tools/#ftp-tools">FTP tools</a> for a list of alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> If your hosting company provides an FTP program that runs inside your browser, we recommend that you do NOT use that for uploading large amounts of files such as a fresh install of Zen Cart. Those are okay for single-file uploads, but unreliable for several files at once.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 3:</strong> While some programs like Dreamweaver have built-in FTP capability, we DO NOT recommend using these programs for uploading more than one file at a time, since they often fail to do mass uploads properly, and do a very poor job of informing you of any failures. Always better to use a program dedicated to FTP activity, and not something that’s merely got rudimentary FTP capability bolted on.</p>

<p>If No stop.  You will need a <a href="/user/first_steps/useful_tools/#php-html-and-text-editors">text editor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not use cPanel File Manager for editing files.</p>

<p>Your webhoster’s control panel (often <a href="https://cPanel.net" target="_blank">cPanel</a> but sometimes a hoster-built tool) is where you will create a MySQL database and user.</p>

<p>If your hosting account has CPanel,
scroll down to the Databases section and click on MySQL Databases.  The Create New Database form should be pre-filled with the username you used to log in to your cPanel.</p>

<p>Enter a name for your database (the version is often used for easy recognition in multi-database environments) and click on Create Database.  Then, click the Go Back button to return to the Databases page.</p>

<p>You will need to create a username and password for this database.  It is NOT recommended to use your cPanel credentials (i.e.: don’t re-use your passwords!).  Scroll down to Add New User, fill in the information, then click on Create User.  Click the Go Back button to return to the Databases page.</p>

<p>Finally, scroll down to the Add User To Database section, make sure the User and Database are filled in correctly, and click on Add.  Checking the ALL PRIVELEGES check box will give your user complete access to the database.  Be sure to scroll down and click on the Make Changes button.</p>

<p>(You need the following permissions on your MySQL user: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX, DROP. &nbsp;&nbsp;On an H-Sphere host, this would be “dba” access, or at least read/write. )</p>

<p>Each web host has his/her own preference in naming folders for use in running a website.<br>
You can have many files that don’t even get shown to the public. The ones that are available for access via a browser are usually in a folder called something like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/home/YOURNAME/public_html</code>
or<br></li>
<li><code>/var/www/YOURNAME/httpdocs</code>
or<br></li>
<li><code>/usr/accounts/a/b/YOURNAME/httpd</code></li>
</ul>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Basically, in your FTP area look for a <code>www</code> or <code>public_html</code> or <code>htdocs</code> or <code>httpdocs</code> or <code>wwwroot</code> folder. These are the common folder names for what is referred to as the <strong>webroot</strong>, which is where all website content is served from.</p>

<p>Your Zen Cart files (or <em>any</em> files to run your website, for that matter) need to be under that folder. If they’re not, then you’re going to get “not found” errors - because the content is not found!</p>

<p>If it’s unclear where the publicly-accessible files are to be uploaded, ask your hosting company for assistance in determining what your <strong>webroot</strong> folder should be.</p>

<h3 id="where-will-my-files-be-in-cpanel">Where will my files be in cPanel?<a aria-hidden="true" href="#where-will-my-files-be-in-cpanel" style="visibility: hidden;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h3>

<p>Your files will go into your webroot, as defined above.</p>

<p>The default webroot in a cPanel environment is usually something like <code>/home/user/public_html</code> where <code>user</code> is the name given to your cPanel account.</p>

<p>In short, in cPanel you’ll almost always see it as <code>public_html</code>.</p>

<p>For initial installation or for staging upgrades; we’ll be setting up a sub-folder with the Zen Cart files, below the <code>public_html</code> folder.  In the case of initial installation, you may want to move or redirect this folder once you have completed setup.  More on that later.</p>

<p>This is the easiest and least error prone method of installing Zen Cart
Installing by FTP is described in the following step.</p>

<p>If your host provides cPanel as your hosting control panel, installation and upgrading can be a much simpler process.  You do not even need an FTP program to complete the task although you will need one for other site operations. This section covers the basic steps to install Zen Cart to your server.  The same steps are used to create a test folder for upgrade or mod installation.</p>

<p>Open the cPanel provided by your host.  Normally, this is done by going to <code>https://YOURSITE.com/cpanel</code> OR <code>https://YOURSITE.com:2083</code>.  You will need your username and password assigned to you when you obtained your hosting in order to log in to the cPanel.</p>

<p>The File Manager is located in the Files Section of cPanel.  Click on the File Manager icon and the File Manager will open.  Unless you are very familiar with the folder tree of cPanel, we recommend opening the Settings and selecting ‘WebRoot’ as the default opening directory.  Refreshing the page will bring up the files currently in your <code>public_html</code> folder.</p>

<p>Next, you will upload <a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/latest" target="_blank">the latest zip file</a> to your server using the Upload menu icon. (You must download the zip file first, before continuing.) Click on Upload and the upload page will appear in the browser.  Drag the zip file to the “Drop files here to start uploading” area and the upload will automatically start.  When the progress bar shows 100% with complete underneath, click on the Go Back link to return to your <code>/public_html</code> folder.  If you don’t see the zip file in the <code>public_html</code> folder, click on Reload in the menu to refresh the page.</p>

<p>Find the zip file.  Normally Zen Cart uses the following naming format when distributing code: <code>zen-cart-CURRENT_VERSION-RELEASE_DATE.zip</code>.  Right-click on the file and select Extract.  You should see a home icon with <code>/public_html</code> pre-filled in the box.  Make sure your browser matches <code>/public_html</code> with no trailing <code>/</code> and click on the Extract File(s) button.  Click Close on the Extraction Results screen.</p>

<p>You now have a new folder in <code>public_html</code> that should match the naming convention of the zip file.  <code>zen-cart-CURRENT_VERSION-RELEASE_DATE</code>.  All the Zen Cart installation files are in this directory.</p>

<p>For clarity, rename the directory to something like <code>catalog</code> or <code>store</code> for this new installation.  If you were creating a directory for an upgrade or to test an addon on a separate store, you should use an appropriate name you can associate with the task.  For now, we’ll give the files a break while we create the database.</p>

<p>Skip step “Installing the Zen Cart fileset using FTP” and go to the following step.</p>

Installing the Zen Cart fileset using FTP<a aria-hidden="true" href="#c-installing-the-zen-cart-fileset-using-ftp" style="visibility: hidden;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2>

<p>This step is only required if you did not install your files using
cPanel in the previous step.</p>

<p>At this point, it is assumed you have a copy of
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/" target="_blank">official download</a>
of Zen Cart.</p>

<p>Upload, via FTP, the whole Zen Cart distribution into a directory on your server.  You can put it in your webroot or in a folder below that.</p>

<p>You can choose to upload to your webroot, or you can choose to upload to a subfolder.  Assuming your webroot is <code>/home/johndoe/public_html</code> and your domain is <code>johndoetools</code>, this is how things will work (assuming you have SSL):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you upload to your webroot, your Zen Cart will be accessed as [<a href="https://www.johndoetools.com](" target="_blank">https://www.johndoetools.com](</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>If you upload to the catalog subfolder of your webroot (i.e. <code>/home/johndoe/public_html/catalog/</code>, your Zen Cart will be accessed as [<a href="https://www.johndoetools.com/catalog](" target="_blank">https://www.johndoetools.com/catalog](</a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This guide uses the <code>/catalog</code> subfolder AS AN EXAMPLE.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don’t have to use <code>/catalog</code>.&nbsp; You could use something else (like <code>/shop</code>), or no subfolder at all (upload directly to webroot).</p>

<p>So in the language defined by <a href="/user/first_steps/basic_terms">Basic Terms</a>, we’ll
be using a <code>YOURSUBFOLDER</code> value of <code>/catalog/</code>.</p>

<p>Choosing a subfolder versus loading the files into webroot is entirely your
choice.  The only time when you would really need to use a subfolder is if you
already have a well established website are just adding on ecommerce using
Zen Cart.  In that case, you’d want to put your store below your existing site.</p>

<p>The installer is fairly intelligent and should be able to automatically supply answers to the questions listed below.</p>

<p>You will, however, need to confirm that the auto-detected answers are, in fact, correct as on some servers they may differ.</p>

<p>You will need the following information for the installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The physical path to your new Zen Cart directory</strong><br>
Example: <code>/home/myusername/public_html/catalog</code></p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Virtual HTTP Path (the URL to your domain and directory for your shop)</strong><br>
Example: <code>http://www.mydomain.com/catalog</code></p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Virtual HTTPS Server (the secure URL to your domain)</strong><br>

<p>Next, it will examine your server for compliance with technical requirements for running Zen Cart, presenting you with several items you may need or want to address with your host. Anything marked in red or with an “X” must be addressed before the installer can continue. Things marked with an orange or yellow “caution” symbol are simply warnings that may or may not apply to your setup now. The image folders and others as described earlier in this document are also noted. If you make changes to your server, you can click Re-Check or press F5 in your browser to refresh the display and reflect the changes you’ve made before proceeding.</p>

<p>If a previous version of Zen Cart is found on your server, the installer will attempt to determine the database patch level and display that on the screen as well. In this case, an “upgrade” button will display at the bottom of the screen offering you the ability to upgrade if needed.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied that the “pre-flight-check” inspection is OK for your needs (ideally, all green check-marks), you may click the “Install” button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>On the next screen, you are asked for Database Information about your MySQL database, username and password. These can be obtained from your cPanel or equivalent control screen provided by your host. If you do not have a clean MySQL database setup with a username and password, you will need to create one.</p>

<p>Contact your Hosting site if you need assistance in creating a MySQL database table and/or username and password. <strong>Note that you need to have your database and userID created before the Zen Cart installer can continue past this screen</strong>.</p>

<p>Other information on this screen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At this time, MySQL is the primary operational database type.<br>

<p>If you would like to install the demo data, select yes.</p>

<p>We recommend that you install the demo data to familiarize yourself with many of the examples created that explain and demonstrate the vast number of features available in Zen Cart.</p>

<p>You may also decide later to set up a test site with the demo data AND a separate working site for your live data so that you have the ability to refer back to the demo data for help and to see examples of a feature.&nbsp; This is an excellent way to learn how things work, and then try your hand at setting up your own site and testing to be sure you’ve done things right. Later on it can be used to help you test an upgrade or test new features you’re working on before affecting your live site.</p>

<p>After you click Save Store Settings, there will be some hesitation as the database tables are created and the demo data is optionally loaded. You will see some progress indicators as the database is loaded.</p>

<p>a) <a href="/user/running/rename_admin/">RENAME YOUR ADMIN FOLDER</a>.  Note that
current versions of Zen Cart do this for you.</p>

<p>b) When you enter the catalog, you will receive security warnings about the <code>configure.php</code> files and the <code>/zc_install</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>configure.php files</strong></p>

<p>You will now want to change the permissions on the configure.php files with <code>chmod 644</code> (or 444 depending on your server, and sometimes setting 444 cannot be done via FTP, in which case use your host’s control panel or file manager to set the permissions level.)</p>

<p>These are located here (remember, “catalog” is what we used as an example here – your site may or may not include “catalog” as a folder name):</p>

<pre><code>/catalog/includes/configure.php
/catalog/admin/includes/configure.php
</code></pre>

<p>It would also be a good idea to download a copy of these files to your computer from the server as they have been setup and configured to your server specifications based on the Installation process.</p>

<p>If you have any errors or problems, most of these can be corrected by minor adjustments to these two files.</p>

<p>c) Remove the <strong>zc_install directory</strong><br>
Next, you will want to delete the <code>/catalog/zc_install</code> directory</p>

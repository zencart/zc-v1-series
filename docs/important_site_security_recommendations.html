    <h1>Zen Cart&#174; Site Security</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Leveraging Resources on the Zen Cart&#174; Website</h2>

      <p>The Zen Cart&#174; Team, along with Zen Cart&#174; Users
      and Contributors, regularly update security recommendations
      on the Zen Cart&#174; Website.</p>

      <p>You may wish to also consult recommendations posted on the
      <a href=
      "https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?115-how-can-i-protect-my-site-from-malicious-attack-plus-security-recommendations">
      Zen Cart&#174; Website</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>SSL Protection</h2>

      <p>A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is the standard
      security technology for establishing a secure and encrypted
      connection between a web server and a browser. This requires
      a SSL certificate from your web hosting provider or a third
      party certificate provider.</p>

      <p>The preferred would be to have a dedicated SSL certificate
      but there may be additional expense involved in obtaining
      this. As a bare minimum, you should use a shared SSL
      certificate provided by your web hosting provider.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Accessing your Site Files Securely</h2>

      <p>Instead of using regular FTP to access your server files,
      it is advisable to use an FTP program that allows Secure FTP
      (SFTP or FTPS).</p>

      <p>This method will encrypt the information you transmit and
      receive. This is important especially when you are
      downloading database backups or configuration files which
      contain usernames and passwords, etc.</p>

      <p>If your web hosting provider does not support Secure FTP,
      you may wish to consider a web hosting provider that takes
      security seriously.</p>

      <h1>Securing your Zen Cart&#174; Store</h1>

      <div id="removeExtraFolders">
        <h2>Remove Extra Folders from your Server after
        Install</h2>

        <div>
          <p>It is important that after you have installed your Zen
          Cart&#174; Store and are satisfied that it is working
          properly, including test transactions to test
          <em>ALL</em>&nbsp; the payment and shipping modules you
          are using.</p>

          <p>Remove the following folders and all the files inside
          them, to minimize security risks:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>/docs</li>

            <li>/extras</li>

            <li>/zc_install</li>

            <li>/install.txt</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It is safe to keep these files on your <em>Local
          PC</em>, since they can be used as
          references/documentation, or used to aid in
          troubleshooting as diagnostic tools, or for
          upgrading/installing again in the future. However, those
          folders and files should <em>NOT</em>&nbsp; be on a live
          webserver.</p>

          <p>If you have no intentions of supporting downloadable
          products or music-media products, you can
          <em>optionally</em>&nbsp; also remove these folders:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>/download</li>

            <li>/media</li>

            <li>/pub</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You will need to go to
          <em>Admin-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Attribute
          Settings-&gt;Enable Downloads</em>, and set it to
          <em>False</em>&nbsp; to turn off the warning message
          about the missing download folder.</p>

          <p>If you choose to add downloadable products to your
          site or music-products, you will want to re-upload these
          appropriate folders (and their contents) to your server
          again, and assign appropriate permissions.</p>
        </div>
      </div><!-- End removeExtraFolders //-->

      <div id="emailTransportMethod">
        <h2>Use "SMTPAUTH" or "SMTP" as your Email Transport Method
        Instead of the Generic "PHP" Setting</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Go to <em>Admin-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Email
          Options</em>, and change your Email Transport Protocol to
          <em>SMTPAUTH</em>, and then fill in the SMTP Credentials
          in the other settings lower on that same screen.</p>

          <p>This will not only help prevent outgoing emails from
          ending up in spam folders, but will also prevent the
          disclosure of your admin foldername when sending emails
          from your admin screens.</p>
        </div>
      </div><!-- End emailTransportMethod //-->

      <div id="setConfigurePHPFiles">
        <h2>Set Configure.php File as "Read Only"</h2>

        <div>
          <p>It is important that you set permissions on the
          configure.php file as Read Only. Typically this means
          setting permissions to <em>"644"</em>, or, in some cases,
          <em>"444"</em>. The configure.php file is located in
          /<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>&nbsp;/includes/configure.php.</p>

          <p>Quite often, setting permissions on a file to read
          only via FTP will not work. Even if the permission looks
          like it was set to read only, it really may not have
          been.</p>

          <p>Verify the correct setting by accessing the store to
          see if there is a warning message on the top of the
          screen: "<span class='errorDetails'>Warning: I am able to
          write to the configuration file:...</span>". In such
          cases, you will need to use the "<em>File
          Manager</em>&nbsp;" supplied by your web hosting
          provider.</p>

          <p>If you are using a Windows server, simply set the file
          as <em>"Read Only for Everyone"</em>&nbsp; and especially
          the <em>IUSR_xxxxx (Internet Guest Account)</em>&nbsp;
          user if running IIS, or the <em>"System
          Account"</em>&nbsp; or <em>"Apache User"</em>&nbsp; if
          running Apache.</p>

          Users"</em>.</p>

          <p>Delete any unused admin accounts. Especially the
          <em>"Demo"</em>&nbsp; account, if it exists.</p>

      <div id="adminPasswordSecurity">
        <h2>Maintain Admin Password Security</h2>

        <div>
          <p>It is wise to use complicated passwords so that a
          would-be hacker cannot easily guess them.</p>

          <p>You can change your admin password in
          <em>Admin-&gt;Admin Access-&gt;Admin Users</em>, and
          click on the <em>"Reset Password"</em>&nbsp; button.</p>

          <p>We recommend that you use passwords that are at least
          8 characters long. Making them alpha-numeric (including
          letters, numbers, upper-and-lower-case, etc) helps.</p>

          <p>If you are going to use normal words, it is a good
          idea to join two words that do not normally go
          together.</p>

        <h2>Use ".htaccess" Files to Protect against Snooping</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Several folders, contain are
          <em>".htaccess"</em>&nbsp; files to prevent users from
          being able to browse through the files on your site
          unless they know exact filenames. Some also prevent
          access to "any" .PHP scripts, since it is expected that
          all PHP files in those folders will be accessed by other
          PHP files, and not by a browser directly.</p>

          <p>If you delete these files, you run the risk of leaving
          yourself open to people snooping around.</p>

          <p>There are also some blank <em>index.html</em>&nbsp;
          files in several folders.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>These files are there to protect you in case your
            FTP software would not upload
            <em>".htaccess"</em>&nbsp; files, or your server would
            not accept them.</li>

            <li>These only prevent directory browsing, and do not
            stop execution of .PHP files.</li>

            <li>This is a good "alternative", although using
            <em>.htaccess</em>&nbsp; files in all of these folders
            is the better choice for servers that accept
            these.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In order for the .htaccess settings supplied with Zen
          Cart&#174; to work, your web hosting provider must
          include either <em>"All"</em>&nbsp; or all of these:
          <em>"Limit Options Indexes"</em>&nbsp; parameters to the
          <em>"AllowOverride"</em>&nbsp; configuration in the
          server <em>apache/conf/httpd.conf</em>&nbsp; file.</p>

          <p>If your web hosting provider does not allow setting
          the <em>"OPTIONS"</em>&nbsp; directive, you will need to
          leave that line out or put a <em>"#"</em>&nbsp; in front
          of it.</p>

          <p>If your web hosting provider does not allow you to
          create/use your own <em>.htaccess</em>&nbsp; files, they
          may provide an interface in your hosting control panel
          where you can set the desired <em>.htaccess</em>&nbsp;
          settings. Work with your web hosting provider to
          configure these settings if this is the method they
          require.</p>

          <p>Your web hosting provider may use web serving
          software, such as <em>Nginx</em>, which do not use
          <em>.htaccess</em>&nbsp; files.</p>

          <p>In the case of <em>Nginx</em>, directives equivalent
          to the <em>.htaccess</em>&nbsp; rules are provided after
          installation of Zen Cart&#174; to serve as a start point.
          These can be found in the
          "/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>&nbsp;/zc_install/nginx_conf/"
          folder.</p>

          <p>It is best to work with your web hosting provider to
          select and implement the best method for your specific
          server.</p>

          <p><span class="errorDetails">You need to choose, and
          use, the appropriate method for your server.</span> The
          Zen Cart&#174; Team cannot prescribe what to use for your

      <div id="protectFolders">
        <h2>Protect your "images" and other Folders</h2>

        <div>
          <p>During initial installation, you are advised to set
          your images folder to <em>"Read/Write"</em>, so that you
          can use the Admin interface to upload product/category
          images without having to use FTP for each one. Similar
          recommendations are made to other files for various
          reasons.</p>

          <p>However, leaving the images (or any other) folder in
          read/write mode means that hackers might be able to put
          malicious files in this (or other) folder(s) and thus
          create access points from which to attempt nasty
          exploits.</p>

          <p>Hence, once your site is built and your images have
          been created/loaded, you should increase the permission
          setting from <em>"Read/Write"</em>&nbsp; to <em>"Read
          Only"</em>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>On Linux/Unix hosts, permission setting
            recommendations for basic security are:

              <ol class="noteList">
                <li>Folders and Directories: <em>CHMOD
                755</em>&nbsp;</li>

                <li>Files: <em>CHMOD 644</em>&nbsp;</li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>On Windows hosts, setting files as <em>"Read
            Only"</em>&nbsp; is usually sufficient.

              <ol class="noteList">
                <li>Double check that the <em>Internet Guest
                Account</em>&nbsp; has limited (<em>"Read
                Only"</em>&nbsp;) access.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The folders for which installation suggests
          <em>"Read/Write"</em>&nbsp; access for setup areoutlined
          below.</p>

          <p>If your site supports .htaccess protection, then you
          should use it for these folders. (The
          <em>".htaccess"</em>&nbsp; files included with v1.3.9 and
          newer should already cover the basics.)</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>/cache</em>&nbsp;

              <ol class="noteList">
                <li>This is used to cache database
                information.</li>

                <li>The BEST security protection for this is to
                move it to a folder "above" the webroot
                (public_html or htdocs or www) area, so that it is
                not accessible via a browser.</li>

                <li>This requires changes to DIR_FS_SQL_CACHE
                setting in the configure.php file as well as the
                setting in the ADMIN AREA for the
                <em>Admin-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Sessions-&gt;Session</em>&nbsp;

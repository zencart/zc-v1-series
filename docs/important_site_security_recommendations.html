			<h2>
				Leveraging Resources on the Zen Cart&reg; Website
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Zen Cart&reg; Team, along with Zen Cart&reg; Users and Contributors, regularly update security recommendations on the Zen Cart&reg; Website.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may wish to also consult recommendations posted on the <a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?115-how-can-i-protect-my-site-from-malicious-attack-plus-security-recommendations">Zen Cart&reg; Website</a>. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				SSL Security Protection Tips
			</h2>
			<p>
				Without applying extra efforts to your connection on the internet you are wandering around an unsecured environment. Before you make administrative modifications to secure Zen CartÂ® and its database, you need to equip yourself with secure ways to make these modifications. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Otherwise if someone is monitoring the information you transmit, it might not be long before your private business information becomes public. The bare minimum you should have is access to shared SSL services from your hosting company.
			</p>
			<p>
				The preferred would be to have a dedicated SSL certificate for your store, as it is more professional in appearance than the use of a shared certificate. There will be an expense incurred to obtain a dedicated SSL certificate and dedicated IP address in your hosting account.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Accessing your Site Files Securely
			</h2>
			<p>
				Instead of using regular FTP to access your server files, it would be wise (if your hosting company offers FTPS support) to use a program that offers FTP over SSL/TLS. This method will encrypt the information you transmit and receive. This is important especially when you are downloading database backups or configuration files which contain usernames and passwords, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your hosting company does not offer SFTP or FTPS, then they are most likely not PCI Compliant either, and you should be choosing a different hosting company who takes security seriously.

				Securing your Zen Cart&reg; Store 
			</h1>
				<ul class="noStyle">
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Remove Extra Folders from your Server after Install</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								It is important that after you have installed your site and are satisfied that it is working properly, including actually doing live transactions to test ALL the payment and shipping modules you are using on your site, be sure to do some cleanup:
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Remove the following folders and all the files inside them, to minimize security risks:
								<ul>
									<li>/docs</li>
									<li>/extras</li>
									<li>/zc_install</li>
									<li>/install.txt</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								It is safe to keep these files on *your* own computer (not the server), since they can be used as references/documentation, or used to aid in troubleshooting as diagnostic tools, or for upgrading/installing again in the future. But those folders/files should *not* be on a live webserver.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Optional: Additionally, *IF* you have no intentions of supporting downloadable products or music-media products, you can *also* remove these folders:
								<ul>
									<li>/download</li>
									<li>/media</li>
									<li>/pub</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								You will need to go to your <em>Admin->Configuration->Attribute Settings->Enable Downloads</em>, and set it to <em>False</em> to turn off the warning message about the missing download folder in the future, if you choose to add downloadable products to your site or music-products, you will want to re-upload these appropriate folders (and their contents) to your server again, and assign appropriate permissions.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Use "SMTPAUTH" or "SMTP" as your Email Transport Method Instead of the Generic "PHP" Setting</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Go to Admin->Configuration->Email Options, and change your Email Transport Protocol to SMTPAUTH, and then fill in all the SMTP credentials in the other settings lower on that same screen.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								This will not only help prevent outgoing emails from ending up in spam folders, but will also prevent the disclosure of your admin foldername when sending emails from your admin screens.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Set configure.php Files as "Read Only"</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								It is important that you set permissions on the two configure.php files as Read Only.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Typically this means setting them to <em>"644"</em>, or in some cases <em>"444"</em>.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								The configure.php files are located in:
								<ul>
									<li>/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>/includes/configure.php</li>
									<li>/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>/<em>&lt;RenamedAdminFolderName&gt;</em>/includes/configure.php</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Quite often setting permissions on a file to read only via FTP will not work. Even if the permission looks like it was set to read only, it really may not have been. You must verify the correct setting by entering the store and seeing if there is a warning message on the top of the screen. "Warning: I am able to write to the configuration file:..." In this case you will need to use the "File Manager" supplied with your webhosting account.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								If you are using a Windows server, simply set the file as <em>"Read Only for Everyone"</em> and especially the <em>IUSR_xxxxx (Internet Guest Account)</em> user if running IIS, or the <em>"System Account"</em> or <em>"Apache User"</em> if running Apache.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Delete Unused Admin Accounts</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Admin-&gt;Admin Access-&gt;Admin Users.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								In your ADMIN AREA, open the <em>"Admin Access"</em> menu and choose <em>"Admin Users"</em>.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Check for any unused admin accounts, and delete them. Especially the <em>"Demo"</em> account, if it exists.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Maintain Admin Password Security</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								It is wise to use complicated passwords so that a would-be hacker cannot easily guess them.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								You can change your admin password in <em>Admin->Admin Access->Admin Users</em>, and click on the <em>"Reset Password"</em> button.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								We recommend that you use passwords that are at least 8 characters long.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Making them alpha-numeric (including letters, numbers, upper-and-lower-case, etc) helps.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								If you are going to use normal words, it is a good idea to join two words that do not normally go together.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Admin Access Protection</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								It is wise to observe caution while working in your admin area:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Use only one browser tab to access your admin area
									</li>
									<li>
										Do not visit other sites when your browser has an active admin login session enabled even in another tab
									</li>
									<li>
										Always log out of your admin when not using it
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Protect "define pages" Content in "html_includes"</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Protect <em>define pages</em> (Admin->Tools->Define Pages Editor) after editing:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Download a copy to your Local PC using your FTP software. 
										<ol class="noteList noStyle">
											<li class="h-margin-left-0">
												They are located in the <em>/includes/languages/english/html_includes/</em> folder and subfolders.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>Make them <em>CHMOD 644</em> or <em>444</em> (ie: <em>"Read Only"</em>).
										<ol class="noteList">
											<li>
												<em>/includes/languages/english/html_includes</em> &ndash; and all files/folders underneath
											</li>
											<li>
												With some web hosting providers, you must use at least <em>CHMOD 645</em> or <em>CHMOD 555</em> for pages to display
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								If you make them <em>"Read Only"</em>, then a would-be hacker cannot edit them if they gain access to your system, unless they can get permissions to change the <em>"Read Only"</em> status, which is more complicated.
								<ul>
									<li>
										<span class="errorDetails">
										Once you set them <em>"Read Only"</em>, you will need to go and set them back to <em>"Read/Write"</em> before making additional changes using the define-pages editor, or uploading replacements via FTP, and then set back as <em>"Read Only"</em> again when done.
										</span>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Use ".htaccess" Files to Protect against Snooping</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Several folders, contain are <em>".htaccess"</em> files to prevent users from being able to browse through the files on your site unless they know exact filenames. Some also prevent access to "any" .PHP scripts, since it is expected that all PHP files in those folders will be accessed by other PHP files, and not by a browser directly.
								<ul>
									<li>
										If you delete these files, you run the risk of leaving yourself open to people snooping around.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								There are also some semi-"blank" <em>index.html</em> files in several folders. 
								<ul>
									<li>
										These files are there to protect you in case your FTP software would not upload <em>".htaccess"</em> files, or your server would not accept them.
									</li>
									<li>
										These only prevent directory browsing, and do not stop execution of .PHP files.
									</li>
									<li>
										It is a good "alternative", although using <em>.htaccess</em> files in all of these folders is the better choice for servers that accept these.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								In order for the .htaccess settings supplied with Zen Cart&reg; to work, your web hosting provider must include either <em>"All"</em> or all of these: <em>"Limit Options Indexes"</em> parameters to the <em>"AllowOverride"</em> configuration in the server <em>apache/conf/httpd.conf</em> file. 
								<ul>
									<li>
										It is a good "alternative", although using <em>.htaccess</em> files in ALL of these folders is the better choice, for servers that accept them.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								If your web hosting provider does not allow setting the <em>"OPTIONS"</em> directive, you will need to leave that line out or put a <em>"#"</em> in front of it. 
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								If your web hosting provider does not allow you to create/use your own <em>.htaccess</em> files, they may provide an interface in your hosting control panel where you can set the desired <em>.htaccess</em> settings. 
								<ul>
									<li>
										It is recommended that you work with your web hosting provider to configure these settings if this is the method they require.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Your web hosting provider may use web serving software, such as <em>Nginx</em>, which do not use <em>.htaccess</em> files.
								<ul>
									<li>
										In the case of <em>Nginx</em>, directives equivalent to the <em>.htaccess</em> rules are provided after installation of Zen Cart&reg; to serve as a start point.
									</li>
									<li>
										These can be found in the "/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>/zc_install/nginx_conf/" folder.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								It is best to work with your web hosting company to select and implement the best method for your specific server. 
								<ul>
									<li>
										<span class="errorDetails">You need to choose, and use, the appropriate method for your server.</span>
									</li>
									<li>
										We cannot tell you what to use for your specific server, but we offer these guidelines as a starting point.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="h-margin-left-0">
						<h2>Protect your "images" and other Folders</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								During initial installation, you are advised to set your images folder to <em>"Read/Write"</em>, so that you can use the Admin interface to upload product/category images without having to use FTP for each one. Similar recommendations are made to other files for various reasons.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								However, leaving the images (or any other) folder in read/write mode means that hackers might be able to put malicious files in this (or other) folder(s) and thus create access points from which to attempt nasty exploits.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Hence, once your site is built and your images have been created/loaded, you should increase the permission setting from <em>"Read/Write"</em> to <em>"Read Only"</em>.
								<ul>
									<li>
										On Linux/Unix hosts, permission setting recommendations for basic security are:
										<ol class="noteList">
											<li>
												Folders and Directories: <em>CHMOD 755</em>
											</li>
											<li>
												Files: <em>CHMOD 644</em>
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										On Windows hosts, setting files as <em>"Read Only"</em> is usually sufficient. 
										<ul class="noStyle">
											<li class="small-string">
												Double check that the <em>Internet Guest Account</em> has limited (<em>"Read Only"</em>) access.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								The folders for which installation suggests <em>"Read/Write"</em> access for setup are these. 
								<ul>
									<li>
										If your site supports .htaccess protection, then you should use it for these folders. (The <em>".htaccess"</em> files included with v1.3.9 and newer should already cover the basics.)
										<ul class="noStyle">
											<li class="h-margin-left-0">
												<em>/cache</em>
												<ol class="noteList">
													<li>
														This is used to cache database information.
													</li>

														The BEST security protection for this is to move it to a folder "above" the webroot (public_html or htdocs or www) area, so that it is not accessible via a browser.

						<h2>Things to Check up on Regularly</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Be sure you have done all the steps listed in this document
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Keep good backups of your website files and database (frequently)
								<ul>
									<li>
										Backup the database over a secure connection (ie: if you are using phpMyAdmin to backup, then make sure you are using HTTPS addresses in your URLs).
									</li>
									<li>
										Backup the website files over a secure connection (If you are copying files via FTP, be sure to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTPS" target="_blank">Secure FTP</a>).
									</li>
									<li>
										Store the backed up database and website files into an encrypted file.
										<ol class="noteList">
											<li class="h-margin-left-0">
												You should <em>NOT</em> keep your backups on your server. If you do however, encrypt them securely.
											</li>
											<li class="h-margin-left-0">
												Ask your web hosting provider for advice.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Check your server errorlog regularly for odd or suspicious activity (Your hosting control panel should give you access to the Apache error_log)
								<ul>
									<li>
										Look for links that lead to pages outside your site
									<li>
										Look for links where <em>"http"</em> appears after <em>"index.php"</em> 
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li>
								Check your website files regularly to be sure nothing has been added or altered
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							<li>
								Ask your web hosting provider what they have done to be sure the server you are on is safe and secure so that outsiders cannot do any harm, and so that other websites on your server cannot be used to get to your site and cause any harm (in case they have security holes in them)
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							<li>
								If your business warrants, or you still want additional assurance (if running ther scripts outside of Zen Cart&reg;), hire a security consultant to audit your site regularly. 
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Check your Zen Cart <em>/cache/</em> folder for leftover files that do not belong there.
								<ol><!-- THIS IS A SPACER //--></ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Check your Zen Cart <em>/logs/</em> folder for <em>"myDebug-XXXXX.log"</em> files to see whether any errors are happening which need to be fixed. Delete the log files after you have addressed the errors.

Authorization
-------------

This project/code is agnostic as to how you provide authorization for your API.

It's expected that you may need to extend the Api Controller to provide authorization and/or role/scope based access.

There will be some more documentation here regarding Authorizartion etc, and you can also look at

`zcwilt/rest-api-demo <https://github.com/zcwilt/rest-api-demo/>`_

which will give some examples of implementing the rest api and how to do authorization.
